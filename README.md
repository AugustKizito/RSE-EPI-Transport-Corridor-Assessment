# RSE-EPI Corridor Early-Warning Framework

Remote Sensing Engineering Performance Index (RSE-EPI) for 
threshold-based early warning and engineering decision support 
in multimodal transport corridors.

## 📌 Overview
This repository provides the full open-science workflow supporting the study:

**Early-Warning Engineering for Corridor Vulnerability:  
A Remote Sensing Threshold Model for Disaster Risk Reduction in Tanzania**

The framework operationalizes Earth Observation (EO) indicators 
(NDVI, MNDWI, Night-Time Lights, terrain exposure) into deterministic 
engineering intervention triggers for transport corridors.

## 🛰️ Application Domain
- Standard Gauge Railway (SGR)
- Central Transport Corridor
- Mtwara Development Corridor  
(Tanzania)

## 🔬 Core Contributions
- EO-derived environmental and utilisation thresholds
- RSE-EPI composite vulnerability scoring
- Spatial Durbin Model (SDM) spillover estimation
- 78–97 day early-warning capability for pre-failure intervention
